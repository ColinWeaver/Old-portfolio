# Portfolio

Description: This is basic web page linking to my contact information. I intend to go back and develop a much more robust portfolio site. 

Context: I initially built this as an assignment in the software development program I am currently enrolled in. I was required to build a portfolio webpage in HTML and CSS following some basic structural parameters such as what types of information to include etc. This was assigned soon after my introduction to HTML and CSS.
