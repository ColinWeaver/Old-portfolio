<article id="about" class="about">
<h2>About</h2>
<p> I spent ages 6-18 training as a classical pianist and had a passion for composing growing up. Other interests of mine (in no specific order) include: Chess, Finance, Psychology, Sociology, Film, and creating WEB CONTENT.</p>
<p> I like to think of effective problem solving as a process that thrives on the balance of 2 things:</p>
<ol>
<li> Generation of ideas AND </li>
<li> effective filtering of those ideas </li>
</ol>
<p> I am an idea person but also analytical which helps me in taking complexity and identifying solutions through the right ideas. I enjoy solving problems and I want to collaborate with others on solving the problem of creating excellent web content. Feel free to reach out. I would love to hear from you! </p>
